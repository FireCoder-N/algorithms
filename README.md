# algorithms

> Programmers donâ€™t talk because they must not be interrupted.... To synchronize with other people can only mean interrupting the thought train. Interruptions mean certain bugs. You must not get off the train.<br>
<strong>~ Ellen Ullman</strong>


In the journey of a programmer, algorithms are often required. However, no matter how simple the idea might seem, searching for suitable implementations online can be challenging and time-consuming, not to mention that the provided code may not function properly.
To address this issue, I will from now on document the algorithms encountered during my programming efforts, in various programming languages, and present them to the community as standalone functions.

*Note: The algorithms presented here are either the product of personal effort or found elsewhere online (such as on Stack Overflow). While each of these functions served their intended purpose within the context of my programming endeavors, I cannot guarantee their correctness, versatility, or efficiency.*
